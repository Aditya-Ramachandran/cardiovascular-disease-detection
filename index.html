   <h1>Cardiovascular Disease Detection using Ensemble Learning</h1>
   <br>
   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) refers to a group of disorders that affect the 
            heart and blood vessels. It is a leading cause of death worldwide and can be 
            caused by a variety of factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, 
            obesity, smoking, and a sedentary lifestyle. Some of the common forms of CVD 
            include coronary artery disease, heart attacks, angina, stroke, and heart 
            failure.
        </li>
        <li>
            Early detection and treatment of CVD is crucial in order to prevent or manage 
            the disease. There are several methods that can be used to detect CVD, 
            including physical exams, medical history assessments, and various diagnostic 
            tests. Some of these tests include electrocardiograms (ECGs), 
            echocardiograms, stress tests, and imaging tests such as coronary angiography 
            and computed tomography (CT) scans
        </li>
        <li>
            In recent years, there have been advancements in artificial intelligence and 
            machine learning algorithms that have the potential to enhance the accuracy 
            and speed of CVD detection. These algorithms can analyze large amounts of 
            data from various sources and use it to predict the likelihood of a person 
            developing CVD. This can help healthcare providers to make more informed 
            decisions and provide patients with personalized treatment plans.
        </li>
        <li>
            Overall, the goal of CVD detection is to identify the disease early, prevent 
            complications, and improve outcomes for patients.       
        </li>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
             <h3>Approach</h3>
             <p>
                The proposed method for predicting cardiovascular disease involves six phases, 
                starting with the selection of a dataset, specifically the cardiovascular disease 
                dataset for this study. Pre-processing of the data involves several necessary 
                steps before training the model. Feature extraction is then performed to assess 
                the significance of the features. To detect cardiovascular disease, the study 
                employs four machine learning classifiers: Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest 
                Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB).
             </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Dataset Selection</h3>
            <p>
                This study uses the Cardiovascular Disease dataset from Kaggle 
                (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset), 
                which contains 13 attributes and samples. The dataset is divided into two parts: 
                one part is used for training models, while the other part is used to evaluate the 
                model's performance
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3> Data Pre-processing </h3>
            <p>
                Before training a machine learning model, the data needs to be pre-processed 
                to ensure its quality and that important information is available to the model. 
                This involves dealing with different characteristics of the dataset, such as 
                missing values, outliers, and scaling. One way to pre-process the data is to 
                eliminate outliers and normalize the data using a standard scaler, which adjusts 
                the distribution of the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. 
                The target labels are also transformed into numeric forms using a Label Encoder 
                so that the machine can read them and make better predictions for disease 
                diagnosis
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Feature Extraction</h3>
            <p>
                Feature selection is a crucial step in machine learning that helps to reduce the 
                dimensionality of the dataset and identify the most important features for 
                classification. The aim is to choose informative features that can enhance the 
                model's performance. Random Forest (RF) feature selection approach is 
                effective in identifying the essential features for classification. This method is 
                widely used in machine learning and has been successful in real-world scenarios.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Classification Models</h3>
            <p>
                To improve the accuracy of cardiovascular disease diagnosis, we will propose an 
                ensemble model based on machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, KNearest Neighbours, and Decision Trees, as well as a stacked model that 
                combines an ML ensemble model with a Random Forest. We will utilize four 
                machine learning techniques, namely Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, 
                Decision Trees, and XGBoost, in our experiment.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3> Ensemble classifier for machine learning models</h3>
            <p>
                Ensemble learning has been widely used by researchers to tackle various 
                machine learning challenges. Due to the diversity of datasets, an ensemble 
                learning approach is adopted to distinguish between different diseases and 
                accurately categorize data. When a new data point arrives, each classifier in the 
                ensemble predicts a class label. The predicted label that receives the majority of 
                votes from the classifiers is considered for that instance. In order to enhance 
                performance, a combination of ML-classifiers and various voting methods are 
                employed, which have shown to outperform the traditional single-learning 
                approach and lead to better generalization results. These strategies can 
                effectively improve the accuracy of the ensemble model and make it more 
                robust.

                <li>
                    <h4>K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN):</h4>
                    <p>
                        K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) is a prominent approach in machine learning used 
                        for regression and classification tasks. It employs similarity measurements, such 
                        as the distance function, to describe new points in the data. The algorithm 
                        depends on the similarity of the items being compared, and classification is 
                        performed based on the majority vote of its nearest neighbours. The accuracy 
                        can improve as the number of nearest neighbours increases, and we used the 
                        default parameter settings provided by the sklearn library.

                <li>
                    <h4>Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost):</h4>
                    <p>
                        Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is another ensemble learning approach 
                        that enhances classification performance and memory resource utilization. It 
                        utilizes a gradient descent technique to optimize the loss function and returns a 
                        prediction as a boosting ensemble of weak classification trees. XGBoost 
                        algorithm stands out for its ability to combine weak ML algorithms with an 
                        adaptive learning method. One of the unique features of XGBoost is that it uses 
                        residual error to adjust the previous prediction to optimize the loss function. The 
                        loss function in XGBoost is regularized to provide an objective function for 
                        assessing the model's performance.

                <li>
                    <h4>Decision Tree:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Decision Tree is a versatile machine learning technique that can handle both 
                        categorical and numerical data. It has a tree-like structure that makes it easy to 
                        understand and interpret. In the medical field, Decision Tree is a widely used 
                        method due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Creating and analysing a treeshaped graph to visualize decision-making is straightforward. Therefore, we 
                        have chosen the Decision Tree classification method as one of the most effective 
                        and extensively utilized approaches for supervised learning. It is easy to build a 
                        robust decision tree model for a specific dataset and can be trained using default 
                        parameters
