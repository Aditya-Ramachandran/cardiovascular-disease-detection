   <h1>Cardiovascular Disease Detection using Ensemble Learning</h1>
   <br>
   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) refers to a group of disorders that affect the 
            heart and blood vessels. It is a leading cause of death worldwide and can be 
            caused by a variety of factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, 
            obesity, smoking, and a sedentary lifestyle. Some of the common forms of CVD 
            include coronary artery disease, heart attacks, angina, stroke, and heart 
            failure.
        </li>
        <li>
            Early detection and treatment of CVD is crucial in order to prevent or manage 
            the disease. There are several methods that can be used to detect CVD, 
            including physical exams, medical history assessments, and various diagnostic 
            tests. Some of these tests include electrocardiograms (ECGs), 
            echocardiograms, stress tests, and imaging tests such as coronary angiography 
            and computed tomography (CT) scans
        </li>
        <li>
            In recent years, there have been advancements in artificial intelligence and 
            machine learning algorithms that have the potential to enhance the accuracy 
            and speed of CVD detection. These algorithms can analyze large amounts of 
            data from various sources and use it to predict the likelihood of a person 
            developing CVD. This can help healthcare providers to make more informed 
            decisions and provide patients with personalized treatment plans.
        </li>
        <li>
            Overall, the goal of CVD detection is to identify the disease early, prevent 
            complications, and improve outcomes for patients.       
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This project is of paramount importance given the surging incidence of 
            cardiovascular diseases across the world. As per the World Health 
            Organization, cardiovascular diseases are accountable for the highest number 
            of deaths worldwide, with an estimated 17.9 million fatalities each year
        </li>
        <li>
            Early identification of individuals at risk of developing cardiovascular disease 
            can help in preventing or delaying its progression, thereby decreasing the 
            associated healthcare expenses. This project endeavors to construct a 
            predictive model that can accurately identify high-risk individuals, enabling 
            early intervention and prevention strategies.
        </li>
        <li>
            As students studying data science, we are deeply motivated to contribute to 
            this project due to its potential to impact the health outcomes of individuals at 
            risk of cardiovascular disease. By leveraging advanced machine learning 
            algorithms and techniques, this project has the potential to provide valuable 
            insights and improve the accuracy of existing diagnostic and screening 
            methods.
        </li>
        <li>
            Overall, this project aligns with our academic interests and aspirations to 
            advance our knowledge and skills in the interdisciplinary fields of healthcare 
            and data science. We are thrilled to be a part of this project and eagerly 
            anticipate the opportunities it provides for us to make a meaningful impact on 
            people's lives through data-driven healthcare solutions.
        </li>
